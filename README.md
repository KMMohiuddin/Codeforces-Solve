# Codeforces-Solve
This is only for the solutions &amp; algorithm of the problems of Codeforces. I highly recommend you to try hard yourself at first &amp; then if you fail, you can only check the logic from our code. Don't Copy-Paste our code exactly. If you do this, your logic will not be improved/developed. So, try to realize the logic. Stay with me
